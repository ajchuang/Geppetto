# Geppetto
a PR2 virtual control system

Geppetto is remote 2-way PR2 controling and feedback system.
By leveraging several kinds of I/O devices (Oculus, Myo, Kinect, and voice recognition), 
we reconstruct the surrounding environments of the robot to the user and pass the user command back to the PR2.

Here is our demo video:
